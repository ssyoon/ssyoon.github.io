I am an Assistant Professor at University of Dayton. I'm studying cognitive biases underlying human decision making, and seek to apply findings from laboratory studies in judgment and decision making to real-life consumer preferences (e.g., consumer preference, financial decision making, advertisement, and risk communications). I am also interested in using a multi-methodological approach, including behavioral, computational modeling, eye-tracking and fMRI, to obtain converging evidence about the underlying mechanisms of decision biases.
