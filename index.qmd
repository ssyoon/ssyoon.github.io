I am an Associate Professor of Marketing at University of Dayton. I'm studying cognitive biases underlying human decision making, and seek to apply findings from laboratory studies in judgment and decision making to consumer behavior (e.g., consumer preference, financial decision making, advertisement, and risk communications). I am also interested in using a multi-methodological approach, including behavioral, computational modeling, eye-tracking and fMRI, to obtain converging evidence about the underlying mechanisms of decision biases.
